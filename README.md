# Autism-Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in individuals based on various features such as behavioral responses, demographic information, and medical history using machine learning techniques.

üß† **Overview**
Autism Spectrum Disorder is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. Early detection is crucial for effective intervention. In this project, we build a classification model to identify whether an individual shows signs of autism based on input features.

üìä **Dataset**

Features may include:

 1. Age
 2. Gender
 3. Ethnicity
 4. Family history of autism
 5. Result of self-administered test (AQ score)
 6. Who completed the test (self/parent/guardian)
 7. Country of residence
etc.

Target Variable: Class/ASD (Yes/No)

üîç **Methodology**

1. Data Preprocessing
   Handling missing values
   Encoding categorical variables
   Feature selection

2. Model Training
   Split data into training and test sets
   Try different classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
   Hyperparameter tuning

3. Evaluation
   Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   Confusion Matrix
